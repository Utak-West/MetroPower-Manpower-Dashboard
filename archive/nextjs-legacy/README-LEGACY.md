# MetroPower Dashboard - Legacy Next.js Implementation (ARCHIVED)

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE

This folder contains the archived Next.js/Vercel implementation of the MetroPower Dashboard that was replaced due to critical functionality issues.

## Why This Implementation Was Replaced

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **API Endpoint Failures**: Core API endpoints were missing or returning 500 errors
2. **Authentication System Broken**: Users could not log in to access the system
3. **Database Connection Issues**: Data was not loading properly from Neon PostgreSQL
4. **CRUD Operations Failed**: Create, Update, and Delete operations were not functional
5. **Export Functionality Missing**: Report generation endpoints were not implemented

### Business Impact
- **0% of required workflows were functional**
- **System could not be used for daily operations**
- **No business value in current state**
- **Immediate alternative solution required**

## Replacement Solution

The MetroPower Dashboard has been migrated to a **Noloco + Airtable** architecture that provides:
- ✅ **Reliable functionality**: No-code platform eliminates API issues
- ✅ **Faster implementation**: 2-3 weeks vs 6+ weeks to fix current issues
- ✅ **Lower maintenance**: Managed services reduce ongoing problems
- ✅ **Better features**: Superior workforce management capabilities
- ✅ **Cost effective**: $708-828/year vs ongoing development costs

└── exports/           # Report generation (missing)
```

### Configuration Files
```
package.json           # Node.js dependencies
vercel.json           # Vercel deployment config
```

## Known Issues (Unfixed)

### Authentication Issues
- Login endpoints return 500 errors
- JWT token generation not working
- Session management broken
- Password reset functionality missing

### Database Issues
- Connection to Neon PostgreSQL unstable
- Query execution failures
- Data synchronization problems
- Transaction rollback issues

### API Endpoint Issues
- `/api/auth/login` - Returns 500 error
- `/api/employees` - Data not loading
- `/api/projects` - 500 server errors
- `/api/assignments` - CRUD operations fail
- `/api/exports/*` - Endpoints not implemented

### Frontend Issues
- Infinite loading states
- Form submissions fail
- Real-time updates not working
- Mobile responsiveness problems

## Migration Notes

### Data Preserved
All employee and project data from this implementation has been migrated to the new Airtable system:
- **Employee records**: Transferred to Airtable Employees table
- **Project data**: Moved to Airtable Projects table
- **Assignment history**: Preserved in Airtable Assignments table

### Functionality Replaced
The new Noloco + Airtable system provides all intended functionality:
- ✅ **Employee Management**: Full CRUD operations working
- ✅ **Project Tracking**: Complete project lifecycle management
- ✅ **Assignment Scheduling**: Drag-and-drop calendar interface
- ✅ **Reporting**: Professional Excel/PDF exports
- ✅ **Mobile Access**: Fully responsive interface
- ✅ **User Authentication**: Secure role-based access

## Historical Context

### Development Timeline
- **September 2024**: Initial Next.js development started
- **December 2024**: Basic frontend completed
- **January 2025**: API development attempted
- **February 2025**: Critical issues identified
- **February 2025**: Migration to Noloco + Airtable decided

### Lessons Learned
1. **Custom API Development Complexity**: Building reliable APIs requires significant expertise
2. **Database Integration Challenges**: PostgreSQL connection and query optimization difficult
3. **Authentication System Complexity**: Secure user management more complex than anticipated
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Custom code requires ongoing debugging and updates
5. **No-Code Platform Benefits**: Managed services eliminate many technical challenges

## Do Not Attempt to Fix

### Why Not to Continue with This Implementation
1. **Fundamental Architecture Issues**: Core problems require complete rebuild
2. **Time Investment**: Would take 6+ weeks to resolve all issues
3. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Custom code requires continuous debugging
4. **Better Alternative Available**: Noloco + Airtable provides superior solution
5. **Business Needs**: Immediate functionality required for operations

### Recommended Action
- **Use the new Noloco + Airtable system** (see main README.md)
- **Do not attempt to deploy this code**
- **Do not spend time debugging these issues**
- **Refer to this archive for reference only**
